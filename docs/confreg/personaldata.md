# Personal data

Personal data must, of course, be collected by the registration system
in order to work. However, as much of that personal data is not needed
past the end of the conference, there is functionality to purge that
data.

The data in that case is typically aggregated and anonymized in order
to still be able to access statistical information, but without any
chance to connect it to a person.

The set of personal data being purged is:

T-shirt size registrations
: This data is aggregated so that it can be used to determine how many
t-shirts in total of each size were selected, to use for future
events.

Phone numbers
:  This data is removed.

Addresses
:  This data is removed.

Dietary needs
:  This data is aggregated so that it can be used as examples for use
with future events (for example, to provide venues with examples and
common responses).

Pronouns
:  This data is aggregated so that it can be used for statistics.

This data is never purged automatically. Instead there is a button at
the top of the conference administration dashboard that gets enabled
when the conference has finished, and remains enabled until the data
has been purged. At regular intervals an email is also sent to the
administrators of the conference to remember to do the purging.

Typically the personal data is kept around a couple of weeks after the
conference, in case it is needed to solve any questions or discussions.
