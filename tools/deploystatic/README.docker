If you have trouble with the dependencies, the Dockerfile in this
directory will build a simple container that you can use. For
example:

docker build -t deploystatic .


And then to use it:

docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/source -v /tmp/statictest:/target deploystatic

(In this case taking the templates in the current directory and deploying the
result to /tmp/statictest - adjust for your own directories)

You can also just specify the default parameters as docker arguments.
