<h2>Finalize registrations</h2>
{%if activewaitlist%}
<p>
  This conference has the waitlist activated. Any remaining seats are
  handled manually. Each attendee must place their own registration
  on the waitlist and pay for it individually. Please advise others
  interested in attending to go to the conference website and make a
  personal registration.
</p>
{%else%}
<p>
  Once you have added all the registrations you want, you can proceed
  to finalize the registrations. If any of the registrations require
  payment, this will create a single invoice for all pending
  registrations. If no registrations require separate payment (such
  as payments done using vouchers), the registrations will be
  immediately completed.
</p>
<p>
  Note that no registrations will be confirmed until this step has
  been completed!
