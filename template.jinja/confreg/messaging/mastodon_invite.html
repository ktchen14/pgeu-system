  In order to let us DM you, you must either have your DMs
  open to the public, or follow <i>@{{mastodonname}}</i>.
  In order to let our systems connect with you
  please send a DM with the token <i>{{token}}</i> to the
  account <i>@{{mastodonname}}</i> (unfortunately, Mastodon
  does not allow us a way to automate this step, so please
  just use copy/paste).
